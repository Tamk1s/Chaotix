REM Batch script which will run conv.bat on each msuic/SFX ASM file 
REM split from the ROM from split.txt ROMulan script

REM This converts each ASM file from Natsumi KC format to S1KC format,
REM as well as slaps on the proper (Target	EQU	$HEXADDR) location to place the songs in the vanilla banks
