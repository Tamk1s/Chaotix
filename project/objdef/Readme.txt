Knuckle's Chaotix objdef for SonED2
by Tamkis

V0.2b, 04/11/11

What is this?

This archive contains object definitions for Knuckles Chaotix for SonED2.
What it does is rename all of the previosly "unknown" objects in the current
version of SonED2 to known objects with better descriptions,
according to AndLabs and my research. It also replaces those annoying "?" icons
for objects with the object's proper sprite image. Furthermore, this archive
contains the source images that I used to make the spritesheets.


How to install:

Put the contents of the archive file into SonED2/Chaotix/Project/objdef.
That's all there is to it!


What's new?

V0.2b
Updated the descriptions of objects based upon further research
Added sprite images for most important objects for SonED2


Known bugs:

The colors of the objects are wrong (the source .bmp files need to be compressed
into 8-bit RLE .tga files, something which can't be done by most modern image conversion
software). If anybody can find modern or old software that can do this, please PM
me, so that I can fix this! (I would prefer x64 software, as I primarily use my Windows 7
laptop, but x86 programs is fine, since I have VM software if the program does not natively
work in x64 Windows 7)

Some objects have the "wrong" graphics (primarily objects whose domain is in multiple zones).
This will be updated and fixed after I research subparams for objects.

Some objects are visually offsetted wrong. (e.g, tran-
sparent rooms) This will be fixed in the next release. 

If there are any other bugs other than these ones, please PM me!
