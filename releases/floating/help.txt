usage:
   flips
or flips patch.ips
or flips [--apply] [--exact] patch.bps rom.smc [outrom.smc]
or flips [--create] [--exact] [--ips | --bps | --bps-delta] clean.smc
  hack.smc [patch.bps]
(for scripting, only the latter two are sensible)
(patch.ips is valid in all cases patch.bps is)

options:
-a --apply: apply patch (default if given two arguments)
-c --create: create patch (default if given three arguments)
-i --ips, -b -B --bps --bps-delta, --bps-linear, --bps-delta-moremem:
  create this patch format instead of guessing based on file extension
  ignored when applying
 bps formats:
  delta is the recommended one; it's a good balance between creation time and
    patch size
    -b and -B both refer to this, for backwards compatibility reasons
  delta-moremem is usually slightly faster than delta, but uses about twice
    as much memory; it gives identical patches to delta
  linear is the fastest, but tends to give pretty big patches
--exact: do not remove SMC headers when applying or creating a BPS patch
  (ignored for IPS)
--ignore-checksum: accept checksum mismatches when applying a BPS patch
-m or --manifest: emit or insert a manifest file as romname.bml
  (valid only for BPS)
-mfilename or --manifest=filename: emit or insert a manifest file exactly here
-h -? --help: show this information
-v --version: show application version
